# Notes:
Words that are definitely english words might be "not found", as I don't have the vectors of those.

Structure:
Get: Generate the word list?
Get: Get the results of a guess. I "guess" that's it.

Post and put: Leaderboard functionality prolly Ill deal with that later

# Instructions for use: 
After cloning the repo, create a folder called word_data. In it, add these three files:
(the final word data stuff I choose to use) 

I would include these in the github if I could, but these are too big for me to upload to github.

# Credits:
This was a personal learning project inspired by [Contexto](https://contexto.me/en/). Word data was taken from sources like [Stanford's  GloVe embeddings](), 

I do not claim ownership of the idea or word data I used- this project was created for educational purposes (teaching me flask and html) and not for commercial use.
